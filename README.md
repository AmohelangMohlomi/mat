# MAT

# Planning Overview

##  Mat is a personal assistant (PA) designed to help users manage their daily tasks, schedule, and personal data. Mat will utilize voice recognition and facial recognition technologies to provide a secure and convenient user experience.

### Features and Functionalities

1. *Task Management*: Mat will help users create and manage to-do lists, set reminders, and prioritize tasks.
2. *Schedule Management*: Mat will integrate with the user's calendar to schedule appointments and events.
3. *Email Management*: Mat will assist users in managing their emails, including filtering, prioritizing, and responding to messages.
4. *Personalized Recommendations*: Mat will learn the user's preferences and habits to provide personalized recommendations for gifts, activities, and more.
5. *Voice Recognition*: Mat will use voice recognition technology to respond to voice commands and interact with the user.
6. *Facial Recognition*: Mat will use facial recognition technology to verify the user's identity and provide secure access to their account.

### Technical Requirements
Programming Language: Python will be used as the primary programming language for developing Mat.

Database Management System: SQLite will be used as the database management system for storing and managing user data during development and prototyping.

#### Why SQLite?
Simplicity: SQLite is a serverless, file-based database, which makes it easy to set up and use with minimal configuration.

Lightweight: It’s ideal for small-scale applications and rapid prototyping like Mat’s initial version.

Integrated with Python: SQLite is built into Python’s standard library via the sqlite3 module, so no external database installation is required.

Portability: The entire database is stored in a single .db file, making it easy to move, back up, or bundle with the application.

No Admin Overhead: No need to manage a separate server or user roles during development.

#### Limitations to Keep in Mind (for future planning)
Not designed for high concurrency — SQLite supports only one write operation at a time.

Limited security features — no user authentication, encryption, or access control out of the box.

Not ideal for cloud or multi-user production — consider migrating to PostgreSQL or another server-based DBMS later.

#### Revised Development Roadmap (DB-specific addition)
During Prototype Development, use SQLite to keep development fast and simple.

Plan for a future migration to PostgreSQL (or another RDBMS) once Mat reaches production scale or needs advanced DB features like user permissions, security, or multi-user concurrency.
### Development Roadmap

1. *Research and Planning*: Conduct research on voice recognition and facial recognition technologies, and plan the development of Mat.
2. *Prototype Development*: Develop a prototype of Mat to test and refine its features and functionalities.
3. *Testing and Debugging*: Test and debug Mat to ensure that it is stable and functional.
4. *Deployment*: Deploy Mat and make it available to users.
